X7Remote
========
Android remote application to control your ActionPro X7 camera with your smartphone.

Motiviation
-----------
Other applications like ActionViewer provide similar or more functionality with these drawbacks:

- Can't connect to camera while it's recording
- Sometimes fails to connect without any reason
- Slow and weird settings menu

This app tries to solve these issues with a focus on usability. Especially solving the first issue allows the most
useful scenario for me: launch X7Remote and hit record, close app and stash phone away, do whatever
you want to record and when finished launch X7Remote again and hit stop.
